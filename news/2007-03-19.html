Hope you Like Pi!

Chess Club is joining in the festivities of Pi day with the math club.  Sadly, Pi day must be celebrated on the 23rd because of the Spring Break overlapping our wonderous holiday, but that doesn't mean we can't celebrate our most favorite irrational number!  Join in this Tuesday in Porter Hall to find out more about the event.  Also, note that there is no meeting this Wednesday due to the festivities.  Enjoy yourself, and welcome back from the break!
