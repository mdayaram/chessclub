Joint Event with the Math Club!
</h3>
This Tuesday the Chess club will be joining with the Math club at A18A Porter hall for a joint event. Details on this are still blurry, but rest assured, they shall be posted as soon as they're cleared up. Please note that the meeting is at 6pm rather than the traditional 6:30pm. See you there!  
<br><br>
So remember to keep an eye out for us, 4:30 to 6:30 in Kirr Commons.  Oh, and of course, free food and drinks while supplies last!
