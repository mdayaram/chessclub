See the Chess Club this Friday at the UC!
</h3>
 The CMU Chess Club has reserved a spot in UC Fridays this friday, February 16, just for you!  You will be able to enter tournaments offering Amazon gift card prices or just play relaxed walk-in games.
 <br><br>
 Everyone's invited!  From experts to novices, we have someone at your skill level to play a game with you!  We may even offer a tutorial session for those interested.
<br><br>
So remember to keep an eye out for us, 4:30 to 6:30 in Kirr Commons.  Oh, and of course, free food and drinks while supplies last!
