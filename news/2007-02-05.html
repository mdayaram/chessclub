<h3 align="center">
Meetings this Week have been Changed!
</h3>
Apparently a pipe burst and thus, we can no longer meet in the Caffee this week.  Instead we're meeting in the Foster Dining Room (this is the room on the second floor in the UC that overlooks the pool) for Tuesday and the Dowd Room for Wednesday.  Times remain the same.  Be sure to show up in the right place!

It takes more than pipes bursting to keep the chess club from meeting!
